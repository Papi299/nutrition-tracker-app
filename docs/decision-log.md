# Decision Log

## 2026-04-28: Initial app foundation

- Created a Next.js App Router project with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, npm, and ESLint.
- Kept the first screen as a minimal foundation page rather than a product feature.
- Deferred Supabase, Vercel deployment wiring, database schema, auth, diary logging, food search, barcode scanning, custom food forms, and recipes.
- Recorded product data-source direction: USDA later for generic foods, and FoodsDictionary later for branded foods only after API/license approval.

## 2026-04-28: Phase 1 i18n and RTL foundation

- Chose `next-intl` for UI localization.
- Chose locale-prefixed public routes: `/en` and `/he`.
- Chose a deterministic root redirect from `/` to `/en`.
- Set English pages to `lang="en"` and `dir="ltr"`.
- Set Hebrew pages to `lang="he"` and `dir="rtl"`.
- Deferred browser-language detection and locale cookies.
- Kept food-search localization separate from UI i18n; no food search was implemented.
- Deferred auth, Supabase, Vercel deployment wiring, database schema, diary/dashboard work, barcode scanning, custom foods, recipes, USDA integration, and FoodsDictionary integration.
