# Decision Log

## 2026-04-28: Initial app foundation

- Created a Next.js App Router project with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, npm, and ESLint.
- Kept the first screen as a minimal foundation page rather than a product feature.
- Deferred Supabase, Vercel deployment wiring, database schema, auth, diary logging, food search, barcode scanning, custom food forms, and recipes.
- Recorded product data-source direction: USDA later for generic foods, and FoodsDictionary later for branded foods only after API/license approval.

## 2026-04-28: Phase 1 i18n and RTL foundation

- Chose `next-intl` for UI localization.
- Chose locale-prefixed public routes: `/en` and `/he`.
- Chose a deterministic root redirect from `/` to `/en`.
- Set English pages to `lang="en"` and `dir="ltr"`.
- Set Hebrew pages to `lang="he"` and `dir="rtl"`.
- Deferred browser-language detection and locale cookies.
- Kept food-search localization separate from UI i18n; no food search was implemented.
- Deferred auth, Supabase, Vercel deployment wiring, database schema, diary/dashboard work, barcode scanning, custom foods, recipes, USDA integration, and FoodsDictionary integration.

## 2026-04-28: Backend architecture direction

- Selected Supabase for V1 backend architecture: Supabase Auth, Postgres, Row Level Security, and Git-versioned migrations later.
- Selected Vercel as the likely hosting target later, after the auth foundation is ready enough to test Preview deployments.
- Supabase fits this product because profiles, manual targets, diary entries, custom foods, recipes, favorites, recents, and later food-source records are strongly relational and need user-owned data isolation.
- Deferred Firebase or similar BaaS because the domain model is strongly relational.
- Deferred separate auth plus hosted Postgres because it adds integration burden before the product needs it.
- Deferred a custom backend because it is overkill for V1.
- RLS is mandatory for future user-owned tables.
- Supabase CLI setup, migrations, package installation, and client wiring are deferred to future implementation PRs.
- Vercel setup is deferred.
- Paid services, dedicated search, USDA integration, and FoodsDictionary integration remain approval-gated.

## 2026-04-28: Supabase client scaffolding

- Added `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`.
- Added minimal browser and server Supabase client helper factories under `lib/supabase/`.
- Centralized public Supabase environment reads for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- Kept environment validation lazy so existing routes can build before real local Supabase values are configured.
- Added only helper scaffolding now so future auth and data work can remain small and reviewable.
- Deferred auth UI, sign in/sign up/sign out, protected routes, database schema, migrations, RLS policies, Supabase CLI setup, and Vercel deployment.
- Deferred composing Supabase session refresh with the existing `next-intl` proxy because that is auth/session behavior and should be planned in the auth phase.

## 2026-04-29: Localized auth UI foundation

- Added localized sign-in and sign-up UI skeleton routes for English and Hebrew.
- Established the route, component, and message foundation before adding auth/session behavior.
- Kept the auth forms inert: no Supabase calls, server actions, route handlers, credential submission, cookie changes, or user creation were added.
- Left `proxy.ts` unchanged; real Supabase auth and session refresh composition are deferred to a future auth implementation PR.
- Deferred protected routes, sign-out, email confirmation, password reset, database schema, migrations, RLS policies, profile/targets work, and Vercel deployment.

## 2026-04-29: Functional Supabase auth and session foundation

- Chose localized Server Actions for email/password sign-in and sign-up.
- Added a small sign-out Server Action for future shell usage without adding protected routes.
- Composed Supabase SSR session refresh with the existing `next-intl` proxy by running locale routing first and applying Supabase cookies to the same response.
- Kept auth errors generic and localized; raw Supabase provider errors are not shown in the UI.
- Made sign-up confirmation-aware: a returned session redirects to the locale home route, while no session shows a localized check-email message.
- Deferred auth callback routes, password reset, OAuth/social auth, protected routes, `next=` return URLs, database schema, migrations, RLS policies, profile/targets work, and Vercel deployment.
